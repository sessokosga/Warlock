##### Project Genesis:
I am fascinated by Collectble Card Games (CCG). I am not really into it, in fact, I haven't had to opportunity to get into it. So I decided to introduce myself into CCG. 
I found CCG great and I wanted to give the opportunity to other people who like me at a time didn't know much about card games grap an idea about what it is and why people find CCG so fun and challenging to play. 
I hope you'll enjoy the experience.
